Please find the file attached to this project called "Pizza.txt". This file will be needed for the program to get pizza sizes, crust, and prices. Three things to note. Firstly you can add as many pizzas as you'd like in whatever order,
EXCEPT for the first line. The first line must NEVER be removed. Secondly, you NEED to keept the SAME format as is shown in the first line on every line. Thirdly, the sizes cannot change. This will change in the future, but for now,
the program will run as if there will be 4 sizes small, medium, large, and xlarge.

Coming Soon:
  Toppings
  Side Items
  Coupon Codes
  Remove/add pizza sizes
